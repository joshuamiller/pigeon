Say you put together a nice site in staticmatic, and now the customer 
wants to be able to add news updates.  You could set up a blog, or 
you could configure a CMS, but all you want to do is add new entries 
and show them on the page.  Pigeon uses the haml layout you already 
wrote and a small one-file Camping app to add and display news items.

Requires:

Camping 2.0 < http://github.com/why/camping/tree/master >
Haml < http://haml.hamptoncatlin.com >

Useful with:

Staticmatic < http://staticmatic.rubyforge.org/ >

To install:

Copy your layout into layout.haml, with a yield where you want 
the content to go.  In pigeon.rb, add your usernames and passwords 
to SetupUsers.  Run camping pigeon.rb to start it up, or point 
Rack or FastCGI at it.

TODO:

Lots, this release is just to get things started.  This is not 
yet a drop-in replacement for a real application.

- Pagination
- User management
- Rack/FastCGI setup inclusion
